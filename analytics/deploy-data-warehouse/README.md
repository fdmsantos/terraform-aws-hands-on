Data warehousing is a critical component for analyzing and extracting actionable insights from your data. Amazon Redshift allows you to deploy a scalable data warehouse in a matter minutes and start to analyze your data right away using your existing business intelligence tools. It’s a fast, fully-managed, and cost-effective data warehousing system.

In this project, you will create and configure an Amazon Redshift data warehouse, load sample data, and analyze it using a SQL client.

## What you'll accomplish:

* **Create an Amazon Redshift cluster** from the AWS Management Console.

* **Configure the cluster** by choosing the instance type and specifying the number of nodes.

* **Secure your cluster** using AWS IAM and set it up for access.

* **Load sample data to your cluster** from Amazon S3 after defining a schema and creating the tables.

* **Set up SQL Workbench/J** to access your data in the Amazon Redshift cluster using the Amazon Redshift JDBC driver.

* **Analyze the data** with standard SQL from SQL Workbench/J.
